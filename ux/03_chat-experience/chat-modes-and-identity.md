# Chat Modes and Identity

Chat changes roles based on context while keeping a consistent UI:
- **Planning phase**: AI travel copilot
- **Browsing locals**: Ask-a-local mode
- **Booked experiences**: Human-to-human chat
- **On-trip**: Concierge and logistics

When minimized and reopened, chat resumes context—no resets, no amnesia.
