# Minimizable Chat

Chat is not the interface; it is the conductor. It must always be minimizable, never modal, never dominant. Its collapsed state signals availability without demanding attention. Expanded chat overlays content rather than replacing it.

Chat reduces cognitive load, enables seamless mode switching, and builds trust by staying out of the way until needed.
