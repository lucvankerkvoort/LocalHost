# UX Principles (Consolidated)

## Map-First
The map is the primary thinking surface. Users reason spatially.

## Progressive Density
- Low zoom: vibes and clusters
- Mid zoom: routes and day groups
- High zoom: specific locals and places

## Routes as Narrative
Routes are storylines, not GPS. Favor calm, expressive paths.

## Chat as Conductor
Chat is always minimizable and never modal. It guides, it does not dominate.

## Split Layout
Map + side panel. Actions in one reflect in the other.

## Desktop vs Mobile
Desktop = planning. Mobile = execution.

## What Not To Do
- Don’t overload the map with avatars.
- Don’t mix planning and execution modes.
- Don’t use modals for core interactions.
